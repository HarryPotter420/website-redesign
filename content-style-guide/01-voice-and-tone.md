# Voice and Tone

The content we make available on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is for many different people and teams. They will use it to make decisions about teaching themselves Node.js, using it for their projects, and about contributing to its development.

We can write content that empowers their decision by being aware of our voice and our tone. Now, let's get to it. What’s the difference between voice and tone?

## Voice vs tone

Your voice is the core of your personality. Voice is consistent across different
contexts, and a well-crafted voice communicates both intent and values.

Your tone will adapt to the emotional state of the person or audience for whom you’re
writing. It would not be a good idea to use the same tone of voice with someone who’s
upset as you would with someone who’s happy.

Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.

## Our voice

Node.js’ voice is relatable. It’s friendly, encouraging, and clear. Our priority
is explaining Node.js and helping our users do what they need with it. We want to
educate anyone using our content. We don't want to patronize or confuse them.

Node.js’ voice is:

* **Helpful**
* **Respectful**
* **Expert**
* **Inviting**

### Examples of voice

The Node.js [Guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/) is one section where content
needs to be instructive. But being instructive should not extend to being bossy. Instead consider inviting your reader to follow the steps you are detailing.

You might say: _"If you'd like to give this a go..."_

Instead of: _"Try it out."_

Formality can be perceived as stuffy or aloof. The Node.js [Get Involved](https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/) section is one place where we want
to be personal and inviting. To achieve this, consider addressing your reader like
a friend.

You might say: _"You're welcome to chat with us about Node.js core features on our
Github issues list!"_

Instead of: _"The GitHub issues list is the place for discussion of Node.js core
features."_

## Our tone

Node.js’ tone is usually informal. When writing content or a response, being clear
and direct is always more important than being entertaining.

Actions are also part of tone. A request for help going ignored for many weeks could be perceived as unwanted and unworthy. A quick response, even if an issue itself remains unresolved, shows compassion and thoughtfulness.

It will help to know the audience and the situation when deciding on the right tone. When writing for an audience, think about asking yourself these six questions:

* Who will be reading this content or post? _This is your intended audience._
* What does the reader want? _This is their goal._
* How familar is the reader with the content? _This lets you tailor your answer
to them._
* What situation is the reader in? _This helps you understand why they are here._
* What emotion is the reader feeling at this moment? _This helps you empathise,
to help better._
* How can you maintain (or better yet, improve) the reader's state of mind? _This
is your goal._

When you understand the context to which the conversation belongs, you can adjust
your tone to fit.

### Examples of tone

The [Issues](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues) tracker of the Node.js Help
repo  is an example of an area where tone is especially important. Users of Node.js
are opening issues to solicit help. It's often difficult to ask for help! You can
make their experience directly interacting with Node.js a good one by putting thought
into using a tone appropriate to the request.

They might say: _"How do I load another .js file and run that new .js file in a new
global context?..."_

You might respond: _"If you really want to do this, you will need to put a wrapper
function around your code, which provides implementations of require, module etc.
You might want to take a look at..."_

The response above is direct, yet respectful. It does not make assumptions about
the best action; that was not asked for. It is straightforward and just provides
the requested answer. It invites, rather than commands, the person to make use of
a suggested resource.

## Quick style tips ⚡️

These are key elements to get started with writing in Node.js’ voice. For details, read Mailchimp's excellently written [Grammar and Mechanics Styleguide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/grammar-and-mechanics/), which inspired this section.

* **Do: Active voice** Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.
* **Don't: Jargon (and slang)** Write in vanilla English.
* **Do: Positivity** Use positive language, instead of negative language.
